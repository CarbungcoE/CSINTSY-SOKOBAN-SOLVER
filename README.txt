the current working algo is on part 2 simplified
to do:
implement freeze deadlock checking
implement corral deadlock checking
things done:
internal representation of game states
a* algorithm
simple deadlock checking (precalculated)
verifying moves

bugs:
deadlock checking whenever the goal is on the edge
(luckily i don't think this will come up as all cases provided have walls surrounding the edge)
